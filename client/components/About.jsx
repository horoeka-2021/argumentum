              <h2>A place of many viewpoints.</h2>
              <p>Social Media had made the world smaller but it hasn&#39;t provided much in the way of allowing for people to hear each others viewpoints.  Crowded comment threads where ego&#39;s are on public display is not an environment conducive to safe discussion.</p>

              <h2>A place to challenge assumptions.</h2>
              <p>We wanted to provide a place where people could select a topic of interest and find people specifically with a different view. A valuable chance to learn and seek to understand a topic from another angle.</p>

              <h2>A place where you are free to disagree.</h2>
              <p>We have made it completely anonymous to encourage the candid exchange of ideas. To limit self-censoring. But also a place that is safe from harassment, where if you choose to end the discussion there can be no further repercussions.</p>

              <h2>A place that&#39;s more than just black and white.</h2>
              <p>Genuinely seeking to understand someone else&#39;s view is a key part of growth. An open society depends on liberal education, and the whole enterprise of liberal education is founded on the principle of free speech.</p>

              <h2>Nonviolent Communication.</h2>

              <p>Funny name but potent methodology. We recommend nonviolent communication for those seeking to strengthen their communication skills and their ability to engineer deeper empathy. Argumentum is a venue to practice nonviolent communication.</p>

              <h3>There are four components to practice:</h3>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Observation:</strong> These are facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. It is said that &quot;When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying.&quot; Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.</li>
                  <li><strong>Feelings:</strong> These are emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another.</li>
                  <li><strong>Needs:</strong> These are universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs. It is posited that &quot;Everything we do is in service of our needs.&quot;</li>
                  <li><strong>Requests:</strong> Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of &quot;no&quot; without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a &quot;no&quot; it is not recommended that one gives up, but that one empathizes with what is preventing the other person from saying &quot;yes,&quot; before deciding how to continue the conversation.</li>
                </ul>
